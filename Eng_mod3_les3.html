            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script</strong> <br><br>
                In the last lesson, we discussed and defined our needs and wants, helping us to better understand what they are and how they impact our life. Today we will talk about the role our <strong><u>personal values</u></strong> play in our wants and needs- this will help us better understand ourselves and what drives our wants and needs.<br><br>
                
                To begin with, what do you think is the meaning of the African proverb, <strong><em>the wealth which enslaves the owner isn’t wealth</em></strong>.<br><br>
                
                We all have different values and beliefs and these <strong><em><u>different beliefs and values</u></em></strong> are what causes us to prioritize some needs and wants over others. Some values include; Religion, Leisure, Security, Money/wealth, Friends, Image/Prestige, Community, Family, Sports, Hard work, Winning, and Comfort.<br><br>
                
Now, take some time and think ABOUT your own values, and how they may impact your needs and wants and the decision you make in your life. <br><br>
                
                Find a friend and discuss how your beliefs and values affect your wants and needs.  <strong>What is the relationship between your values and your needs? </strong> <br><br>
                
                Going back to the proverb we mentioned at the beginning, <strong>The wealth which enslaves the owner isn’t wealth. </strong><br><br> 
                The proverb states that, <em><u>we should not sacrifice our values so that we are not enslaved by our wants</u></em>. <br><br>
                
Over the next few days, as you think more about your personal values and how they influence what you need and want in your life.
