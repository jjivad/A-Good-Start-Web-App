            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script</strong> <br><br>
                We will begin by looking at a proverb. Think about its meaning and we’ll come back to it at the end of lesson. <strong><em>‘Communication does not work if two people speak at the same time’</em></strong>, African proverb.<br><br>
                
 Now, we will go through what communication is and why it is important in a family. Family communication creates a healthy and strong relationship between the members. <br><br>
                
                <strong>Communication</strong> involves the exchange of verbal and non-verbal information allowing members to express their needs, wants and concerns to each other. <br><strong>Basic communication</strong> skills begin with listening, speaking, asking questions and providing feedback. In a family, <strong>instrumental</strong> and <strong>affective communication</strong> is utilized. <br><br>
                
                <strong><u>Instrumental communication</u></strong> is the exchange of information that helps fulfill family functions such as delegation of duties. <br>
                <strong><u>Affective communication</u></strong> is the way family members communicate their emotions to one another such as sadness, joy and anger. It is important to ensure that both forms of communication happen in a family. <br><br>
                
                For this to happen, communication should be made <strong>frequent</strong>. This is achieved by finding time to spend together either over meals or creation of time.<br>
                With creation of such time, family members find the avenue to meaningfully communicate on issues that affect them. With the challenges that face us it is important a family can communicate clearly and directly. This is important for problem solving by communicating emotions and feelings clearly. <br>
                <strong>Vague communication</strong> kills the emotional bonding in a family making it difficult for members to explain their feelings.  <br><br>
                
                Let us look into <strong>Empowering a Child to Communicate Effectively. </strong><br><br>
                
                Words spoken to a child have a great impact, either to empower or disempower. Language spoken to children helps them to grow in <strong>mind, body and spirit</strong>. Empowering children ensures they gain <u>confidence</u> and increase their <u>self-esteem</u>, which makes them feel happy and comfortable with who they are. Empowering children <strong>builds resilience</strong> in them, allowing them to bounce back after what life throws at them. Children can be better learners if only they are encouraged to.  They can understand that they can <u>achieve their dreams with determination</u>. <br><br>
                
                <strong>Empowering children</strong> is the act of making them know they are strong, more confident especially in controlling their life and claiming their rights. <br>
                Empowering them is to make them feel valued and can make decisions whenever required to. This does not mean that children should be left to make their own rules, but children be guided since they learn a lot from their parents.  <br>
                <strong>Empowering words</strong> include <strong><em><u>want</u></em></strong>, <strong><em><u>feel like</u></em></strong>, <strong><em><u>can</u></em></strong>, <strong><em><u>will</u></em></strong> and <strong><em><u>choose</u></em></strong>. Unlike empowerment, disempowerment demotivates the children.<br><br>
                
                To empower children, parents need to give them responsibilities. This helps a child to acquire <strong>problem solving skills</strong> and discover their abilities even more. When a task is accomplished, parents should <strong>recognize and celebrate</strong> using words of <strong>affirmation</strong> and when it’s not achieved, <strong>words of encouragement</strong> and guidance to children should be used. Since parents are children’s first role models, they should strive to <strong>live by example</strong> and involve children in <strong>family decision making</strong>. Lastly, children need <strong>guidance and support</strong> in all they do by encouraging them to achieve their goals.<br><br>
                
                Now let us revisit the proverb from the beginning of the class. <strong><em>Communication does not work if two people speak at the same time.</em></strong><br><br>
                
                The proverb means, <em><u>In order to grow, develop or learn, one cannot communicate or try to communicate at the same time as another person. Communication needs to be careful and clear, and all sides need to be heard</u></em>. <br><br>

When a family unit is able to communicate effectively, they can avoid problems. When we encourage our children and family members to communicate with us openly and without judgement, we are able to thrive as a family unit and as a community.
