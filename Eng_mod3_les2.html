            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
                In the last lesson, we discussed the role of money and how it makes us feel in our lives. Today we are going to discuss the <strong>difference between wants/needs</strong> in our lives. <br><br>
                
                But first, what do you think is the meaning of the proverb, <strong><em>you should not hoard your money and die of hunger</em></strong>. Think about it and we’ll come back to it at the end of the lesson.  <br><br>
                
                Let’s explore in more detail, the difference between <strong>needs</strong> and <strong>wants</strong> and why it is important to think about them if we are to have happy and healthy lives.  <br><br>
                
                <strong>Needs</strong> are items necessary for <strong>your survival</strong>, without them you would not be able to survive or without them you would <strong>compromise your health and wellbeing</strong>.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Wants</strong> are items you buy because <strong>you want them</strong>, they give you <strong>pleasure or happiness</strong>, but they are <strong>not necessary</strong>.<br><br>
                
                I will now read out a list of items. Thinks and decide whether they are a want or a need. If you are unsure, you can also place it between the two. The items are; <u><em>Water, a car, food, clothing, a bike, football, shelter, a computer, a phone and health care</em></u>. <strong>(pause after every item)</strong>. <br>
                Find a friend and discuss.<br><br>
                
To help you decide ask yourself<br><br>
                <strong><em>
- Is this item required for your survival? <br>
                    - If you did not have this item could you continue living in a health life? </em></strong><br><br>
                
After deciding which ones are needs and  which ones are wants, think about how much money the NEEDS would cost vs the WANTS.<br><br>
                
                Add up the cost of the needs and cost of the wants. <strong>(Pause for the listeners to finish then follow up with the following questions)</strong><br><br>
                
Now, reflect on the following questions and try answer them.
            </p>
                <ol><strong><em>
                    <li> What do you notice about the cost difference between the needs and the wants? </li>
                    <li> Did this difference surprise you?</li>
                    <li> What do you feel when our needs are not being met? What do you feel when we are not able to meet our needs? </li>
                    </em></strong></ol>
            <p id="paraContent">
Now think back to the proverb we looked at the beginning of the seminar. What do you think is the relationship between the proverb and our wants and needs? <br><br>
            
                The proverb explains that <em><u>we should prioritize our money so that we ensure that our needs are covered before we save or spend money and that we should make sure that we save only what we can without suffering or putting our health at risk.</u></em> <br><br>

                What a great lesson we have had exploring the differences between wants and needs. Not only did we get a chance to look at these differences, but we also got to <strong>think about how much our wants and needs cost!</strong> Over the next few days, I would like you to think about your own wants and needs, and whether you feel there is anything that you can switch from a need to a want.
