            <p id="paraContent">
            In this lesson we will look at Kenya and its different cultures and how outside forces shaped its borders and those of surrounding countries.<br><br>

In our last lesson we learnt the different types of societies/culture. I will read out a list of communities and you can match them with whether they are hunters, herders, farmers, or people from the city.
            </p>
<ol>
    <li>	Turkana people</li>
    <li>	Kikuyu people</li>
    <li>	Somali people in North Eastern Province</li>
    <li>	People in Mombasa</li>
    <li>	Maasai people</li>
    <li>	Luo people living around Lake Victoria</li>
            </ol>
<p id="paraContent">
    <strong>Do you know why such diverse and different people all ended up in the same present-day country, in the same borders? </strong><br><br>
    <em>This is Because of colonial occupation. Over 100 years ago, the British came to East Africa and spread their rule over its peoples through a mixture of military power, settlement building, and controlling natural resources. They were using the peoples' land to make themselves rich. They created borders - lines on a map - to separate their colonies from those of other European countries, such as Italy, Germany and France. When Kenya fought and won independence, these borders stayed the same. So there are all these different groups, with very different ways of living, all in the same country.</em><br><br>

    Does this story sound familiar? <strong>Can you think of any other country where this happened? </strong><br>
Share with a friend.<br><br>

    Lastly, <strong>how do the modern politicians treat the people in their countries?</strong> Do you think they treat people fairly? Take some time and think about it and then share your thoughts with a friend.
