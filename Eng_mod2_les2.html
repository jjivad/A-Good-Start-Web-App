            <p id="paraContent">
            In the last seminar, we discussed human and refugee rights – can you please take some time to recall the rights we mentioned in lesson 1. <br><br>

                To start off, what do you think is the meaning of the African proverb: <strong><em>Seeing is different than being told</em></strong>. think about it and we’ll come back to it at the end of the lesson.<br><br>

We will go through a series of scenarios where human and refugee rights may have been abused. Listen to the scenario and let’s think if this is a human/refugee right abuse and why? <br><br>

                <strong>Scenario 1 </strong><br>
It is the end of the month and Ashad and his wife, Astur, have only a few rations left for them and their 3 children. Astur informs Ashad that their baby, the youngest child is very ill and has been getting worse of the course of the day. She has a very high fever. Ashad tells her the baby will be fine and that has planned to go meet up with some friends. Later that evening, when he returns, and is feeling very hungry, he discovers that Astur has traded the rations for medicine for the baby. The baby is still sick, but seems to be doing better.<br><br>

                <strong>Scenario 2</strong><br>
Dominique has been told by her friend Desira that there is a new education programme opening for young women. The programme is to teach young women how to make clothes to sell in the marketplace. So Dominique decided to find out more about the programme. When she asks John, one of the worker in charge of the programme, he tells her that he can help her get into the programme, but in exchange she will have to have sex with him. When she tells Desira about this, Desira tells her that she had sex with John to get into the programme. <br><br>

                <strong>Scenario 3</strong><br>
Deng has just opened up a small shop in the marketplace where he is selling a few small items. He has invested all his money into the shop and has worked hard to make it possible. One morning he arrives at the shop, to discover it has been destroyed. His neighbouring shop owner, Michael, tells him it was a group of young boys who had destroyed it. Later, Deng discovers that it was actually Michael who had destroyed his small shop.<br><br>

                <strong>Scenario 4 </strong><br>
Ayana has been in the camp for 5 years and has 3 small children. Her husband died the year after they arrived in the camp, so she is raising them alone. Her son, Rada has been attending school and is trying to find ways to help his mother support the two younger children. Neither of them has a cell phone, and do not have access to Bamba Chakula, which means that they aren’t getting access to all of their rations. One day, Rada decides to steal a cell phone from one of the teachers at the school, so that his family will have access to the Bamba Chakula. The teacher finds out it was him and informs Ayana.<br><br>

                Now that we have thought about situations where we feel our rights are being affected, I want  you to think of an ideal situation where all of your rights are being met.  <em>Take your time to think about it or share with a friend.</em><br><br>

After listening to the scenarios, how do you think our session today is related to the proverb?<br><br>

                The proverb means, <strong><em>when we experience something ourselves, it may be very different than how someone else experiences it. Therefore, our perspectives, and our interpretation of events are ours alone and no one can tell us what we see, feel and experience.</em></strong><br><br>


-	How did you feel listening to the scenarios today?<br>
-	Have you ever experienced anything similar to any of the scenarios? <br>
-	What do you feel you have  learned/explored in the session  today?<br><br>
