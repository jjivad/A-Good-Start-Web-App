                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
In our third module, we will discuss our financial life, our understanding of money and money’s role in achieving our goals. <br><br>
We will begin by reflecting on the meaning of two proverbs: <br><br>
                
                <strong>1st proverb</strong>: <em>One cannot both feast and become rich </em><br>
                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: <em>By labor comes wealth. </em><br><br>
                
What do they have to do with money and visualizing the future? Think about it and we’ll come back to it at the end of the lesson. <br><br>
                <em><u>Why do you think we have money</u></em>? <em><u>What is the role of Money</u></em>? Take some time and think about it.<br><br>
                
                <strong>We use money in exchange for goods and services</strong>. Sometimes we get stipends or we are paid when we work, and then we use that money to buy what we need and want in our lives. Sometimes money is also given to us when we need it.<br><br>
                
                <em><u>In what other ways can we get goods and services, for example, food, clothing, schooling, toiletries?</u></em> Take some time and think about it.<br><br>
                
                We sometimes exchange <strong>things</strong> for <strong>goods</strong> and <strong>services</strong> as well.  Sometimes we will have something someone else wants and needs, and they will have something we want and need, and we will trade it- this is called <strong>bartering</strong>.<br><br>
                
                <em><u>Can you think of types of items/services you barter for in the market</u></em>? Write down your thoughts or share with a friend.<br><br>
                
Now that we are aware of the items we acquire through Bartering, lets talk about other ways we get goods and services. <br><br>
                
                Sometimes we may have to <strong>borrow</strong> money. This means that someone will give us money they have, this could be a <strong>bank</strong> or a <strong>person</strong>, and then we must <strong>pay them back</strong>. <br><br>
                
                <em><u>Have you ever borrowed money from anyone else? What happens if you don’t pay the money on time</u></em>? <br><br>
                
                When we do not pay debts on time, we have to pay an extra fee called <strong>interest</strong>, which is usually a percentage of the money that we have borrowed. To avoid paying interest, we have to pay the money on time! If we cannot pay our money on time, we get into <strong>debt</strong>- this is when we owe money to a person or a bank.<br><br>
                
                <em><u>When we have a lot of money how do we feel? When we have enough money to pay for our food, bills, house and family how do we feel? When we do not have enough money to pay our food, bills, house and family how do we feel? When we have no money or are in debt how do we feel?</u></em> Share your thoughts with a friend.<br><br>
                
                We can now see a link between our <strong>financial situation</strong> and our <strong>emotions</strong>. This is why money is also important- how we use and spend money, and having money, are both directly related to how we feel. <br><br>
                
Now think back to the proverbs that we looked at, at the beginning of the lesson.<br><br>
                
                <strong>1st proverb</strong>: <u>One cannot both feast and become rich</u>. <em>This proverb means that we cannot spend our money as it comes and become rich- it is important to save and use our money wisely.</em> <br><br>
                
                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: <u>By labor comes wealth</u>. <em>This proverb explains that we must work for our money, and that nothing comes for free.</em> <br><br>

                Now that we know why we have money and how it makes us feel, we will begin to <strong>think critically about how we use our money</strong> and what we need to spend our money on to ensure that we have our needs met. <br>
                Over the next few lessons, I would like you to notice how you feel about your spending or your lack of money and ask yourself if you think there are better ways you could use money.
