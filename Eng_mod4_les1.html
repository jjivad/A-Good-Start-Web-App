            <h2 id="h2content">Lesson 1: What is Culture?</h2>
            <p id="paraContent">
            In this lesson we talk about what culture is, and understand how it can be so different across the world.<br><br>
                First, let us define what culture is. Culture refers to the <em><strong>ideas, customs and social behavior of a particular people or society</strong></em><br><br>

To understand why cultures become different, listen to this story.<br><br>
                <em>
Imagine one tribe of people living together.<br>
They wander the land, looking for water, food and livestock.<br>
They do everything together.<br>
They all speak the same language.<br>
They all have the same religion.<br>
They all look similar.<br><br>

One day, a group of friends decides to leave the tribe. They convince a few others to go with them.<br>
Perhaps there was a disagreement in the tribe.<br>
Perhaps the tribe was getting too big and was naturally splitting.<br>
Or perhaps, the friends just want to wander the Earth.<br>
Whatever the reason – they leave.<br><br>

This new group wanders for years, and finally settle down in a new place.<br>
They have children, and eventually their children have children.<br>
None of them ever see the old tribe again…<br>
But life continues. <br><br>

Over time, the descendants of new group forget the old tribe.<br>
They are their own tribe now, with their own way of life.<br>
They talk with different accents, even different words.<br>
They eat different food.<br>
They have different important places.<br>
They even start believing in different things.<br><br>

One day, hundreds of years later, a person from the new tribe goes on a long walk…<br>
…and meets someone from the old tribe.<br>
But when they meet, they are strangers.<br>
They are dressed differently.<br>
They speak different languages.<br>
They believe in different things.<br>
They even look different…<br><br>

But they are still human beings, with the same needs, feelings and dreams.<br><br>

Imagine tribes splitting again and again, hundreds and hundreds of times over thousands and thousands of years.<br>
                </em>
That is how all humans and their cultures came to be so different.<br><br>

There are Real-life examples of this story. For example:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>	The Dinka and the Nuer</li>
                    <li>	The Maasai and the Samburu</li>
                    <li>	The Turkana and the Pokot</li>
                    <li>	The Americans and the British</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="paraContent">
                <em><strong>Do you know any real life experiences that relate to the story? </strong></em>Take some time and think about it and the share your thoughts with a friend.
