            <p id="paraContent">
            Now that we have learned about our rights, learned how to identify our emotions and learned how to solve problems, let’s take all that forward and think how we can use these skills to make changes in ourselves, or in our communities.<br><br>

In this session, we will look at 2 proverbs that relate to our topic and we’ll reflect on them at the end of the lesson.<br><br>

                <strong>1st proverb</strong>: <em>Until a lion learns how to write, every story will glorify the hunter </em><br>
                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: <em>When a man is stung by a bee, he does not burn all beehives</em>. <br><br>

Now let’s ask ourselves the following questions and reflect on them:
            </p>
<ol><strong><em>
    <li>	What are 3 things you have done in  your life that made you feel proud?</li>
    <li>	What 3 things have you learned about yourself since the beginning these lessons of A Good Starts?</li>
    <li>	Think of 3 changes you will make to improve your life. They do not have to be big – they can be something very simple. But small actions can lead to big changes.</li>
    <li>	Think of 3 changes you will make to improve the lives of people around you – or maybe your community. Again, these changes can be small and simple.</li>
    <li>	If you want, you can write these answers down or share them with a friend.</li>
    </em></strong></ol>
            <p id="paraContent">
Back to the proverbs we mentioned at the beginning of the session, The proverbs speak of the importance of creating our own future/realities, also that it is up to us to respond in ways that will lead us to positive transformation, thus leading to a better future.
