                <strong>Script </strong><br><br>
                Welcome to our fifth module. In this module we will explore our personal and sexual well-being. Today, we are going to discuss how to identify the <strong>role of relationships</strong> and explore the different <strong>types of relationships</strong> that we have. This will enable us to gain a clear understanding on what can be <strong>healthy and unhealthy relationships</strong>.<br><br>
                
                What do you think is the meaning of the saying: <u><em>A relationship is like a house, when a light bulb burns off, you do not go and buy a new house, you fix the light bulb</em></u>. Think about it and we’ll come back to it at the end of the lesson.<br><br>
                
Let’s look at how to identify healthy and unhealthy relationships. But first, we have to understand what a relationship is. <br><br>
                
                <strong>Without using the word, ‘relationship’ how would you describe a relationship? </strong><br><br>
                
                <strong>Relationships</strong> can be defined as the way in which people are connected, or the way in which people behave towards each other.<br><br>
                
                <strong>What are some of the ways that people can be related?</strong><br><br>
                
                People can be related through <u><em>blood</em></u>, <u><em>marriage</em></u>, <u><em>friendships</em></u>, <u><em>colleagues</em></u>, <u><em>tribes</em></u>, <u><em>nationality</em></u>, <u><em>ethnicity</em></u>, <u><em>humanity</em></u> and so on.<br><br>
                
                <strong>What would you call a healthy relationship?</strong><br><br>
                
                A <u>healthy relationship</u> is a good, stable, happy, respectful, trust, honesty and a supporting relationship.
What would you call an unhealthy relationship?<br><br>
                
An unhealthy relationship is one in which physical, mental, spiritual or emotional abuse takes place, in which one partner is more controlling over the other, or more dominant.<br><br>
                
From the above definitions, I know you can relate to the different relationships you have seen. <br>Find a friend with whom you will reflect and answer the following questions with.
            </p>
                <ol><strong><em>
                    <li>	Why is it that most unhealthy relationships have some form of conflict? </li>
                    <li>	What are some of the skills that you have learnt in the previous modules that can help you deal with the situations presented above? </li>
                    <li>	Why do people still get into unhealthy relationships? </li>
                    <li>	How can you help someone who is an unhealthy relationship?</li>
                    </em></strong></ol>
            
                    <p id="paraContent">
                        Now, let us reflect on our own life. <em><u>Let’s identify all our relationships and can you determine whether they are healthy or unhealthy?</u></em><br> Take a couple of minutes and think about this. Think about yourself and if you have the right people and the right relationships around you.<br><br>
            
                        Back to the proverb we mentioned at the beginning of the class, <strong><em>A relationship is like a house, when a light bulb burns off, you do not go and buy a new house, you fix the light bulb.</em></strong> <br><br>
            
                        The proverb states that a relationship is like a house, meaning <u><em>it should stand firm and strong like a house</em></u>, and if a light bulb goes off in the house, meaning <u><em>a problem may arise in the relationship, you do not go and get a new relationship or a new house, you just go and fix the bulb</em></u>. A healthy relationship is not one that does not have problems, but it means that you find healthy ways to fix those problems and positive ways to deal with situations that you may encounter in life. <br><br>

 I hope you have been able to see and reflect on the various relationships around us and the differences between healthy and unhealthy relationships.
