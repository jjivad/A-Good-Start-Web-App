            <p id="paraContent">
            In the last session, we focused on the problem solving steps. <br>
Today we are going to practice these steps by looking at our scenarios … first let’s look at the following African proverbs.<br><br>

                <strong>1st proverb</strong>: <em>If you can’t solve your problems in peace, you can’t solve war</em> <br>
                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>:<em> A warrior fights with courage, not with anger</em> <br><br>

Wat do you think is the meaning of these proverbs and how do they relate with problem solving? Think about it and we’ll get back to it at the end of the lesson.<br><br>

We are going to revisit the same scenarios that we looked at in our previous sessions.<br><br>
 
                <strong>Scenario 1</strong><br>
It is the end of the month and Ashad and his wife, Astur, have only a few rations left for them and their 3 children. Astur informs Ashad that their baby, the youngest child is very ill and has been getting worse of the course of the day. She has a very high fever. Ashad tells her the baby will be fine and that has planned to go meet up with some friends. Later that evening, and is feeling very hungry, he discovers that Astur has traded the rations for medicine for the baby. The baby is still sick, but seems to be doing better.

                <li> What is the problem? </li>
                <li> Do you agree with Astur’s decision to trade the rations for medicine? Why or why not? </li>
                <li> What could Astur have done instead? </li>
                <li> Come up with a way Ashad should respond to this. What should he say to Astur? </li>
                <li> Come up with a way Astur should respond to this. What should she say to Ashad?</li>

                    <strong>Scenario 2</strong><br>
Dominique has been told by her friend Desira that there is a new education programme opening for young women. The programme is to teach young women how to make clothes to sell in the marketplace. So Dominique decided to find out more about the programme. When she asks John, one of the worker in charge of the programme, he tells her that he can help her get into the programme, but in exchange she will have to have sex with him. When she tells Desira about this, Desira tells her that she had sex with John to get into the programme. 
            </p>
            <ol><strong><em>
                <li> Should Dominique have sex with John to get into the programme? What  do you think?</li>
                <li> Should Desira encourage Dominique to have sex with John because she did?</li>
                <li> What should Desira have done instead? </li>
                <li> When we see an issue of fraud or abuse of power in the camps whom do we talk to about it?</li>
                <li> Should John continue is his role? </li>

                        <strong>Scenario 3</strong><br>
Deng has just opened up a small shop in the marketplace where he is selling a few small items. He has invested all his money into the shop and has worked hard to save up enough money to sell things out of it. One morning he arrives at the shop, to discover it has been destroyed. His neighbouring shop owner, Michael, tells him it was a group of young boys who had destroyed it. Later, Deng discovers that it was actually Michael who had destroyed his small shop. 
            </p>
            <ol><strong><em>
                <li> What should Deng do in this situation? How should he deal with the fact that Michael lied to him and destroyed his shop?</li>
                <li> What would have been a better way for Michael to deal with this situation? What could he have done instead of destroying Deng’s shop? </li>
                <li> What could Michael do now to make the situation better?</li>

                            <strong>Scenario 4</strong> <br>
Ayana has been in the camp for 5 years and has 3 small children. Her husband died the year after they arrived in the camp, so she is raising them alone. Her son, Rada has been attending school and is trying to find ways to help his mother support the two younger children. Neither of them has a cell phone, and do not have access to Bamba Chakula, which means that they aren’t getting access to all of their rations. One day, Rada decides to steal a cell phone from one of the teachers at the school, so that his family will have access to the Bamba Chakula. The teacher finds out it was Rada who stole the phone and informs Ayana.
            </p>
            <ol><strong><em>
                <li> What should Ayana do in this situation?</li> 
                <li> What could Rada have done instead of stealing the phone?</li>
                <li> Did the teacher make the right decision by telling Ayana? Could he have done something different?</li>

                                Now that we have gone through the scenarios and thought about them using the problem solving steps, let’s think about the proverbs. The proverb means that, <u><em>to solve problems we need to do so in a way that is peaceful and calm. That if we get angry, frustrated and out of control, we will not be able to find solutions that benefit US or OTHER PEOPLE in the long run.</em></u><br><br>

I want you to think of a problem in your own life and how you could use this approach to solve it. For the next few days, each time you are confronted with a problem, think of the best way
