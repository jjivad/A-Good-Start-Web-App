            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script </strong><br><br>
Now that we have explored the role of budgeting in our lives, let’s take a look at income and how it relates to budgeting.<br><br>
                
                Let’s begin by looking at 2 proverbs <br><br>
                <strong>1st proverb</strong>: <em>A single bracelet does not jingle.</em> <br>
                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: <em>A single stick may smoke, but it will not burn.</em> <br><br>
                
                What do you think the two proverbs mean? <br>
                Think about it and we’ll get back to it at the end of the lesson.<br><br>
                
                <em><u>What do you think the word income means?</u></em><br><br>
                
                <strong>Income</strong> is money received through work and stipends<br><br>
                
To understand this better, add up the TOTAL income for this family. You can write the numbers down or do it with a friend. <br><br>
                
                <em>In a family, Momma makes 2350 Ksh , Papa makes 1300 Ksh, Yonas makes 400 Ksh, Liya makes 1400 Ksh , Kamali and Ife don’t make anything because they are both still babies.</em><br><br>
                
                How much does this family of 6 make in total? <strong>(Pause)</strong><br><br>
                
Now let’s explore budgeting this 5450 Ksh by exploring the family’s expenses.<br><br>
                
                For a month they have the following expenses: 
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Baby formula: 1300 Ksh, </li>
                <li>Food: 2500 Ksh, </li>
                <li>School fees: 500 Ksh, </li>
                <li>Diapers: 400 Ksh,</li> 
                <li>Soap: 200 Ksh </li>
                <strong>(Pause)</strong>
            </ul>
                <p id="paraContent">
Now discuss with your friend the following questions;
            </p>
                <ol><strong><em>
                    <li>	Are they able to make enough money to cover their needs?</li> 
                    <li>	Do they have any money left for wants? </li>
                    <li>	How much money do they have left? </li>
                    <li>	What should they do with the money they have left?</li>
                    </em></strong></ol>
            <p id="paraContent">
Let’s revisit the proverbs we mentioned at the beginning of the lesson. <br><br>
            
                <strong>1st proverb</strong>: <em>A single bracelet does not jingle. </em><br>
                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: <em>A single stick may smoke, but it will not burn. </em><br><br>
            
                These proverbs mean, <em><u>we are more successful when we pool our income or work together toward a common goal. So, when we put our money together, we can get more done</u></em>. <br><br>
            
I trust the module had a great impact to how you view your needs and wants, money and how to budget.
