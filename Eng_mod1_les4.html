                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
                Now that we have discussed <strong>who we are</strong> and <strong>what our motivations are</strong>, our next step is to see how we can <strong>reframe our perspective</strong>. How do WE take our challenges? How do WE turn our challenges into <strong>opportunities</strong>? Today we will focus on taking OUR challenges and fears and turning them into inspiration and opportunities.<br><br>
                
We will begin with two African proverbs, reflect on them, try and get their similarity and we will come back to them at the end of the lesson.  <br><br>
                
                <strong>Ist Proverb</strong>: <em>When a home is burnt down, the rebuilt home is more beautiful</em>  <br>
                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: <em>The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago; the second-best time is now.</em> <br><br>
First, let us understand what an opportunity is. <br>
                An <strong>opportunity</strong> is a <em>time or set of circumstances</em> that makes it <strong>possible</strong> to do something. The key word here is <strong>POSSIBILITY!</strong><br><br>
                
                In this lesson, we will focus on turning our challenges into possibilities <strong>with positive thinking</strong>. <br>
Let us answer the following questions: You can write down your answers or share with a friend
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>	If you choose any one item that you would never run out of, what would it be and why?</em></li>
                    <li><em>	If you could be an animal, what animal would you be and why?</em></li>
                    <li><em>	If you could choose an age that you could be forever, what age would you choose and why?</em></li>
            </ol>
            
            <p id="paraContent">
                Now let us look at our challenges.<strong> What are some of the challenges you face in your daily life? </strong><br><br>
                Examples might be: <em>Challenges to getting food, Challenges getting a job, Challenges accessing formal education and many more</em>.<br><br>
                
                Let’s see how we can turn the problems/challenges into <strong>OPPORTUNITIES</strong> through the concept of <strong>POSSIBILITY</strong>!<br><br>
                
Think about how we use words/ideas/thinking to create meaning in our lives. How we think/describe things has so much impact on how we see them… for example, look at the two proverbs from the beginning of class. <br><br>
                
                The first proverb, <strong>when a home is burnt down, the rebuilt home is more beautiful</strong>, means, although the house is burnt down, instead of focusing on the burnt house- we focus on rebuilding a more beautiful house! – <em>We are taking a challenge/problem and turning it into an opportunity</em>.<br><br>
                
Take a few moments and identify how the challenge is turned into an opportunity in the second proverb. <br><br>
                
                Now that we have looked at the language of possibility in the proverbs, how do we apply this to the challenges we face? <strong>This does not mean we will find an instant solution to our challenges, No. but we will find a <u>different way</u> of looking at them! </strong><br><br>
                
                For example, we can restate the challenges using questions. A challenge such, as not having enough food to eat, we can turn that to a  possibility by asking, <strong>“In what ways might we work together to ensure we are all fed?”</strong><br><br>
                
                Now, think about your <strong>challenges</strong> and come up with other ways to change them into a possibility. <br><br>
                
                Has this made you see challenges differently? Using language to turn challenges to possibilities gives us a feeling of <strong><em>hope, happiness, positivity, inspiration and possibility.</em></strong> <br><br>
                
                Using the language of possibility allows us to take our challenges, reframe them and turn them into possibilities. Over the next few days, <em>as you face challenges in your life, think about ways that you can reframe them into possibilities!</em>
