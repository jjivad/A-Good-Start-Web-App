            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script </strong><br><br>
Today, I want us to discuss ways in which we can deal with pressure from other people in a positive way to enable us to have the right frame of mind within our relationships.<br><br>
                
                What do you believe is the meaning of the saying, <strong><em>A dead fish shall always follow the current of a river?</em></strong> <br>Think about it and weâ€™ll come back to it at the end of the lesson.<br><br>
                
Let us explore what it means to have a friend or partner influence you to do something that you are not comfortable with. <br><br>
                
Find a friend with whom you can discuss these questions:  
            </p>
            <ol><em>
                <li>	Have you ever been influenced by your friends or partners to do things that you did not feel comfortable with? In that situation, what would you have done differently? <strong>(Pause)</strong></li>
                <li>	In your sexual and personal relationships, are you sometimes influenced to do things or engage in practices that you do not feel comfortable with? <strong>(Pause)</strong></li>
                <li>	In your family relationships, are you influenced to behave in a certain way or do certain things because your family expects it and not because you want to? <strong>(Pause)</strong></li>
                <li>	How has culture affected how you behave in your relationships? <strong>(Pause)</strong></li>
                <li>	Has social media and free access to information, influenced how you view your relationships? Your sexual encounters? Your cultural heritage? <strong>(Pause)</strong></li>
                </em></ol>
                <p id="paraContent">
                    Now, I want you to <strong>write a letter to your younger self</strong>. If you want, you can just make up a speech in your head for yourself instead. Tell that younger self what you wish someone would have told you now.<br><br>
            
                    Back to the proverb we mentioned at the beginning of the session, <strong>A dead fish shall always follow the current of a river.</strong> <br><br>
            
                    This saying states that a river has a current that always flows in a certain direction. Fish that are alive can swim against the current and they do not always follow it. However, a fish that is dead cannot swim but only goes with the current, and <em><strong>therefore someone who has no character always goes with the crowd, never thinking or analyzing what is best for them, but doing things to only please others.</strong></em> <br><br>
            
This session was very heavy with a lot of conversations. Through it all I hope that you have been able to think about the various ways in which you can manage peer pressure.
