                <em>Welcome back everyone!</em><br><br>
                
                Today we are going to talk about who we are and what makes us different and similar to other people. This will allow us to think more about how unique and special every one of us is! The session will include activities that will help you understand yourself better and your colleagues. <br><br>
                
                To start of, what do you think is the meaning of the African proverb: <strong><em> Don’t set sail using someone else’s star.</em></strong> <br>Think about it and we’ll come back to it at the end of the lesson.<br><br>
                
In trying to understand yourself and others, we will ask ourselves some questions. These questions will help us reflect more on the topic. <br><br>
                
                It is important to know what others think about us. This could help us see positive elements that we might not have seen and help us to understand ourselves better.<strong> Why do YOU think it is important to know how others see us?</strong>  You can write down your thoughts or share them with a friend. <br><br>
                
                It is fundamental that we know how we see ourselves since it helps us take care of ourselves and to see our strengths, weaknesses and knowing where we need to grow. <strong>Why do YOU think it is important to know how we see ourselves?</strong> You can write down your thoughts or share them with a friend.<br><br>
                
It is also important to know our similarities since it helps us not to judge others and to avoid war, violence and confrontation.  Why do YOU think it is important that we know what makes us similar? You can write down your thoughts or share with a friend.<br><br>
                
                Knowing the uniqueness among us helps us to appreciate our differences that bring excitement to the world and helps us to see that we are all special. <strong>Why do YOU think is it important to know what makes us and others unique?</strong>  Write down your thoughts.<br><br>
                
Now, close your eyes for a minute or look down and think of 6 words that describe you. Once you are done, take your journal and draw a big circle. Remember the 6 words you thought of to describe yourself, maybe some describe what you look like, maybe some describe what you are inside , for example, your personality. <br>Draw all the words that describe you on the outside, on the outside of the circle, and the ones to describe you on the inside, on the inside of the circle. Don’t worry if you don’t know how to draw well this is a fun activity!  <br><br>
                
Now find a friend and exchange your drawings. Your friend will try and guess what you meant with each drawing inside and outside of the circle and check if they guessed it correctly. <br><br>
How did it feel when other people guessed things about you or described you correctly? <br><br>
                
Going back to the proverb that we mentioned at the beginning of the session, how do the exercises you have completed relate to it? Discuss with a friend or write your thoughts down. <br><br>
                
                The meaning of the proverb, <strong>to set sail on someone else’s star</strong> means that <em>we are not doing what is best for us, that each person has a unique set of skills, strengths and characteristics and the decisions THEY make in THEIR lives are best of them. If we just try to follow others, we may not be happy.</em> <br><br>
                
We all have unique characteristics, strengths and skills. It is important to appreciate each other’s similarities AND differences.  For the next few days, try to notice some of your unique skills and strengths and those of the people around you.
