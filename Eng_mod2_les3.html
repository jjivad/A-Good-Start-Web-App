                <strong>Script</strong> <br><br>
   Today we are going to focus on the emotions we feel when our rights have been taken away either by someone we love or by someone we trust. By understanding how we and others may feel in difficult situations helps us learn how to communicate in a way that will help us stay safe and find opportunities. <br><br>
                
                To start off, what do you think is the meaning of the African proverb: <strong><em>The teeth are smiling, but is the heart?</em></strong> Think about it and we’ll come back to it later.<br><br>
                
                <em>When we want to communicate our rights- or tell someone what we want, we need to <strong>understand and share our feelings</strong>. This is a healthy way to communicate and helps us get what we want and deserve, which will then bring us closer to our dreams and goals.</em>  <br><br>

Now, we are going to learn how to identify emotions. To help us understand this topic well, I will read you the 4 scenarios from the last session and let you answer some questions after each one of them.<br><br>

                <strong>Scenario 1</strong><br>
It is the end of the month and Ashad and his wife, Astur, have only a few rations left for them and their 3 children. Astur informs Ashad that their baby, the youngest child is very ill and has been getting worse of the course of the day. She has a very high fever. Ashad tells her the baby will be fine and that has planned to go meet up with some friends. Later that evening, when he returns, and is feeling very hungry, he discovers that Astur has traded the rations for medicine for the baby. The baby is still sick, but seems to be doing better.

                <strong>Scenario 2</strong><br>
Dominique has been told by her friend Desira that there is a new education programme opening for young women. The programme is to teach young women how to make clothes to sell in the marketplace. So Dominique decided to find out more about the programme. When she asks John, one of the worker in charge of the programme, he tells her that he can help her get into the programme, but in exchange she will have to have sex with him. When she tells Desira about this, Desira tells her that she had sex with John to get into the programme.

                <strong>Scenario 3</strong><br>
Deng has just opened up a small shop in the marketplace where he is selling a few small items. He has invested all his money into the shop and has worked hard to save up enough money to sell things out of it. One morning he arrives at the shop, to discover it has been destroyed. His neighbouring shop owner, Michael, tells him it was a group of young boys who had destroyed it. Later, Deng discovers that it was actually Michael who had destroyed his small shop.

                <strong>Scenario 4</strong> <br>
Ayana has been in the camp for 5 years and has 3 small children. Her husband died the year after they arrived in the camp, so she is raising them alone. Her son, Rada has been attending school and is trying to find ways to help his mother support the two younger children. Neither of them has a cell phone, and do not have access to Bamba Chakula, which means that they aren’t getting access to all of their rations. One day, Rada decides to steal a cell phone from one of the teachers at the school, so that his family will have access to the Bamba Chakula. The teacher finds out it was him and informs Ayana.

            <ol><strong><em>
                <li> What do you think Ayana is feeling when she doesn’t have enough food for her children? </li>
                <li> What do you think Rada is feeling when he sees his mom and siblings suffering? How do you think he is feeling when he stole the phone? </li>

                From all the 4 scenarios, as we mentioned, naming and knowing our emotions is the first step to <strong><em><u>understanding our rights and pursuing our goals!</u></em></strong>  <br><br>
            
                Now that we have looked at the importance of emotions in communicating our rights, let’s revisit our proverb. <em>What do you think this proverb has to do with communication?</em> <br><br>
            
                The meaning of the proverb is that, <strong>sometimes we do not show what is in our heart- so our teeth may show a smile but we have different feelings inside. Learning to identify those feelings in ourselves and others is very important</strong>. <br><br>
            
As we wrap up, In the next few days, I want you to try to notice, maybe in a challenging or unfair situation what feelings you are feeling, and then try to imagine what feelings the other person might be feeling.
