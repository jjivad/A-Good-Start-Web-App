                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
Today we shall explore our self-worth. <br><br>

We will begin by reflecting on the following proverbs <br><br>

                <strong>1st proverb</strong>: <em>People learn how to treat you based on what you accept from them </em><br>

                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: <em>Sometimes the hardest part of the journey is believing that you are worthy of the trip</em><br><br>

Think about their meaning and weâ€™ll get back to that at the end of the lesson.<br><br>

                Now, let us look at <strong>our self-worth</strong>. It is important to have a great value of oneself, before you can expect others to respect and value you as well. <br><br>



Find a partner and discuss the following questions, or just think about them on your own:
            </p>
                <ul><strong><em>
                    <li>	How is your self- worth related to your ability to be in healthy sexual relationships?</li>
                    <li>	Can there be too much when it comes to exploring your sexuality?</li>
                    <li>	What do you think of transactional sex? Sex in trade for gifts or money</li>
                    <li>	Is it easier for men to pay for sex than women and why?</li>
                    <li>	Are men able to be more sexually permissive than women? Why?</li>
                    <li>	What is more important, how other people value you, or how you value yourself</li>
                    </em></strong></ul>
<p id="paraContent">
    <strong>1st proverb</strong>: People learn how to treat you based on what you accept from them <br>
    <em><u>People treat you how you let them treat you</u></em>. <br><br>

        <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: Sometimes the hardest part of the journey is believing that you are worthy of the trip<br> 
    Explanation: <em><u>Self-doubt can be your own worst enemy. Believe in yourself- believe that you are worthy of love and respect</u></em>.
