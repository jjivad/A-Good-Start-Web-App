            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
                <em>Welcome to the second module of A good Start!!</em><br><br>
                We have talked about our dreams and our goals in the previous module. Now, let us talk about our rights as they also <strong>impact our ability to move towards a better future</strong>. As humans and as refugees we have rights. As we begin to understand our rights, we also begin to further understand and explore our opportunities! <br><br>
                
                To start of, wat do you think is the meaning of the African proverb; <strong><em>They tried to bury us, but they did not know that we were seeds.</em></strong> What do you think it has to do with rights? Think about it and we will come back to it at the end of the lesson.<br><br>
                
                In trying to understand what a human is, we are going to discuss what Mr. Mandela meant by <em>“<u>humanity</u>”</em> and how we can protect human beings. <br><br>

                Think about qualities that make us human beings. <strong>come up with some ides on what makes us human</strong> and we will come back to it later.<br><br>

                What do you think we need to protect and develop our qualities as human beings?  <strong>write down your thoughts or share with a friend.</strong> What happens if one or some of these human rights and protection are taken away? How would we feel? You can write down your thoughts or share with a friend <br><br>
                
Now, let us define rights and human rights:<br><br>
                
                Rights are <strong>legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom</strong>.<br><br>
                
                Human rights are <em><strong>rights or freedom that belong to ALL human being despite nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or any other status, These rights are protected by the law.</strong></em> <br><br>

There are a total of 30 Human Rights. Here are some important human rights that YOU should know:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>	Right to practice your culture and belief</li>
                    <li>	Right to opinion and information </li>
                    <li>	Right to rest and leisure</li>
                    <li>	Right to desirable work </li>
                    <li>	Right to social security</li>
                    <li>	Right to marriage and family </li>
                    <li>	Right to own property</li>
                    <li>	Right to asylum in other countries</li>
            </ul>
<p id="paraContent">
    Now that we know what human rights are, we are going to talk about the rights that apply <strong>specifically to refugees and asylum seekers</strong>. <br><br>
    Let us define who a <strong>refugee is</strong>. Think about it for a moment.
    A Refugee is <u>someone who has crossed a border and cannot return home due to persecution (danger)</u><br><br>

So refugees are human being just like everyone else and have the same human rights, but they also have rights that are extra important for them. Let’s explore these rights together!  <br><br>
On top of all your other human rights…as a refugee, you also have the right to the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Admission to safety – being safe in the country you are living in (Kenya)</li>
                <li>Access to fair refugee procedures – being allowed to get refugee status</li>
                <li>Respect in the country you live (Kenya)</li>
                <li>Protection/safety in the country you live in</li>
                <li>The right to education</li>
                <li>The right to family</li>
                <li>The right to legal advice </li>
                <li>The right to NEVER be sent back to your country of origin if you are in danger</li>
            </ol>
                <p id="paraContent">
Now, draw a picture in your journal that shows your rights and the rights of your community. This doesn’t have to be as your life is now, but instead as you think your life should be if all your rights are being respected.<br><br>
                    
                    Now, let’s look at the proverb we mentioned at the beginning of the session, <strong>They tried to bury us, but they did not know that we were seeds</strong>. This proverb means, even in difficult times, we still have power and potential.
