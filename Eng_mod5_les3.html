Today we will get into gender and sexuality. We will look at how our culture has influenced our beliefs and actions towards sexuality and gender. <br><br>
                
First, we will begin by looking at two African proverbs:<br><br>
                <strong>1st proverb</strong>: <em>A people without the knowledge of their past, history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots. </em><br>

                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: <em>Food is the only one universal thing that bring people together, no matter the culture people will always come together to eat.</em> 
<br><br>
                
                <strong>Culture</strong> is defined as ideas, customs, social behavior of a particular people or a society. <br><br>
                
    <strong>Gende</strong>r is the state of being either male or female. <br><br>
                
    <strong>Sexuality</strong> is the way people express themselves sexually. It involves biological, erotic, emotional, physical, social and spiritual feelings and behaviors. <br><br>

Find a friend preferably of the opposite sex with whom you can discuss the following questions. <br><br>
                
                <strong>For the Man, reflect on the following:</strong>
            </p>
                <ol><em>
                    <li>	What do you think is the most difficult aspect of being a man?</li>
                    <li>	What is the one thing that men value above all else when it comes to their relationships?</li>
                    <li>	What is sexuality to a man? </li>
                    <li>	Is it important for men and women to connect sexually in a relationship?</li>
                    </em></ol>
            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>For the woman, reflect on the following:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol><em>
                <li>	What do you think is the most difficult thing about being a woman?</li>
                <li>	What do women value most when it comes to their relationships?</li>
                <li>	What is sexuality to a woman?</li>
                <li>	Is it important for women to connect emotionally in a relationship?</li>
                </em></ol>
            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Now, Find a friend with whom you will discuss how your individual cultures have affected the way you view issues to do with gender and sexuality such as:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol><em>
                <li>	What it means to be a real man (the characteristics)</li>
                <li>	What it means to be a good woman (the characteristics)</li>
                <li>	Pre-marital sex</li>
                <li>	Extra-marital affairs</li>
                <li>	Monogamy and polygamy </li>
                <li>	Being a homosexual (gay)</li>
                </em></ol>
            <p id="paraContent">
Back to the proverbs we mentioned at the beginning of the session. <br><br>

                <u>1st proverb</u>: <strong><em>A people without the knowledge of their past, history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.</em></strong> <br><br>

                This proverb states that, <u><em>A person who has no idea about their origin, past and history, is not a strong person</em></u>. There is a great pride when people <strong>understand who they are and why do they do the things they do</strong>. As much as we have differences, those differences make us unique and make us who we are. They make us strong and they make us stand tall and confident. When we do not know our history, we cannot be strong in the world and can be easily influenced. <br><br>

                <u>2nd proverb</u>: <strong><em>Food is the only one universal thing that bring people together, no matter the culture people will always come together to eat. </em></strong><br><br>

                The proverb states that, <u><em>Food is a cultural thing</em></u>. People have different food and different ways of preparing and eating food, but the most important thing is that <strong>food brings us all together. Wherever you find yourself in the world</strong>, you must eat food, and food is a great way of bringing different cultures together to appreciate different aspects and different cuisines.
