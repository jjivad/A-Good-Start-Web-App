                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
                
In this lesson we will explore how we prioritize our spending when we have a certain amount of money- to make sure we spend our money in a way that will help us take care of ourselves and others.<br><br>
                
                Let’s first reflect on these two proverbs:<br><br>
                <strong>1st proverb</strong>: <em>Better little than too little. </em><br>
                <strong>2nd proverb</strong>: <em>You cannot name a child that is not born. </em><br><br>
                
                Think about what they might mean and we’ll come back to them at the end of this seminar.<br><br>
                
                <u>What is Budgeting</u>? <strong>(Pause)</strong> <u>Why do we Budget</u>? <br><br>
                
                <strong>Budgeting</strong> is comparing the cost of items with the amount of money you have, and prioritizing what is most important. <br><br>
                
                <u>Whether you have a lot of money or just a little, a budget can help you in many ways. </u><br>
For example:
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>	If you have a budget and stick to it, you will be less likely to misuse your money during random daily spending.</li>
                    <li>	A budget can help you reach a financial goal because it controls how much you spend and how much you save.</li>
                    <li>	Budgets can help eliminate many money surprises because you’ve planned ahead and know what to expect each month.</li>
                    <li>	Budgets help you see exactly where your money goes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Let’s explore an example budget</strong> - Amina has a monthly budget of 3000 Ksh for her family of 5 people. Her father is ill and cannot go without medication. Last month she spent almost all the money on medication because he was very ill. So the family is very low on rations, they haven’t eaten for two days.<br><br>
            
                Find a friend, use the 1-2-3 method from last session to look at this basic list of things and decide how Amina should budget her money. The items she can spend her money on are: <strong>water at 50, food at 500, medication at 2000, airtime at 150, chocolate at 200, salon trip at 1000, a new dress at 500.</strong><br><br>
            
Now let’s take a look at our proverb and explore it is related to this topic of budgeting.<br><br>
            
                <em><u>Better little than too little.</u></em><br>
                <em><u>You cannot name a child that is not born.</u></em><br><br>
            
                <strong>The first proverb</strong> states that <em><u>it is better to have a little bit of something than nothing</u></em>. So to get that bit we need to ensure that we budget enough for it.<br><br>

                <strong>The second proverb</strong> states that <em><u>you cannot plan for something that you don’t have</u></em>. We must make sure that we have the money before we use it, or that we don’t use more than we have. <br><br>
In the next few days, think about ways in which maybe you could spend your money in better ways.
