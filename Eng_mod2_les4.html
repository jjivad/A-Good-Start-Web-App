            <p id="paraContent">
            In the last session, we talked a lot about emotions and how people feel in difficult situations.<br> 
                Can anyone remember any of the feelings/emotions that we talked about last seminar? <br><br>

                <em>Today, we are going to focus on finding good ways to solve problems so that we can get the outcomes/opportunities that we want in our lives. </em><br><br>

                To start off, what do you think is the meaning of the African proverb: <strong><em>Strategy is better than strength?</em></strong> Think about it and we’ll come to it later.<br><br>
 
                Now, let us look at the problem solving process:  <u>When we want to achieve our goals and dreams, we often have to solve problems to overcome our challenges.</u> <br><br>

 Did you know that there are special steps to make problem solving easier? Let’s look at them now.<br><br>

                <strong>First step</strong>: <em><u>Identify the problem</u></em> - make sure that you know what the problem is.<br><br>

                <strong>Second step</strong>:<em><u> Understand how everyone feels/what they want</u></em> - Understanding how everyone is feeling helps us to find solutions.<br><br>

                <strong>Third step</strong>: <em><u>Identify possible solutions</u></em> - think of ways to improve the situation by taking into account everyone’s feelings<br><br>

                <strong>Fourth step</strong>: <em><u>Evaluate the possible solutions </u></em>- what are the results/outcomes of each solution?<br><br>

                <strong>Fifth step</strong>:<em><u> Select a solution</u></em> - choose the solution that seems to make the most sense and is most relevant for your problem.<br><br>


                Back to the proverb we mentioned earlier, <strong><em>Strategy is better than strength.</em></strong>
                The proverb means, <em>with strategy you can win a battle without fighting, but with strength you have to fight in order to win.</em><br><br>

Now that we have gone through the problem solving steps, I want you to share with another person something new that you have learned in this lesson. It can be something simple or complex- just one thing you feel was a new idea.
