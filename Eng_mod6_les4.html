                Today, we will begin by reflecting on the following proverb and we’ll get back to it at the end of the lesson. <strong><em>‘A man with a cough cannot conceal himself’</em></strong>.<br><br>

                Now, Let us go through how bad nutrition or malnutrition can cause diseases. <br><br>
                
What is the meaning of a disease? Can you remember the definition of nutrition and nutrients? <br><br>
                
As mentioned earlier, nutrition is important for the body and if the body lacks certain nutrients, it is easy to get certain diseases. These diseases are caused by insufficient or excessive nutrients. The following are some examples of nutritional diseases, causes and symptoms:

                    Now let us revisit the proverb we mentioned at the beginning of the session. <em><strong>‘A man with a cough cannot conceal himself ’.</strong></em><br><br>
                    
                    The proverb states that, A person who has a cough cannot be able to hide.<em><u> A person who is sick cannot pretend that they are not, so it is better to prevent the sickness in the first place and to avoid causing any problems</u></em>. <br><br>
            
I hope the lesson was interesting and you got to learn a lot. The aim was to ensure you plan your meals accordingly taking into consideration the nutrient requirements of the body to prevent diseases.
