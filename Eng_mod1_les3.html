            <p id="paraContent">
                <em>Welcome back everybody</em><br><br>
                Now that we understand who we are, our similarities and differences, and what makes each one of us unique, let’s explore what <strong>MOTIVATES</strong> us- both from the <strong>INSID</strong>E and the <strong>OUTSIDE</strong>. <br><br>
                
                What do you think is the meaning of the African proverb; <strong><em>when there is no enemy within, the enemy outside cannot hurt you.</em></strong> Think about it and we will review it at the end of the lesson.<br><br>
                
First, let’s define what is motivation and why it is important. <br><br>
                
                Well, <strong>Motivation is a reason/reasons for behaving in a certain way.</strong>  It is important because it helps us to be <u>better people, to work hard, to learn, to keep healthy and to try new things.</u> For example, <em>going jogging to lose weight and studying to do well on a test.</em> What other examples of motivation do you know? You can write down your thoughts or share with a friend.<br><br>
                
                There are <strong>two</strong> types of motivation: There is, <strong>External motivation and internal motivation</strong><br><br>
                
                <strong>External Motivation</strong> is something outside of us pushing us to do something. It could be a reward, praise and money while <strong>Internal motivation</strong>  is something inside of us is pushing us to do something, we enjoy it and it makes us feel good. <br><br>
                
                Now listen to these phrases and decide whether they are <strong><u>external</u></strong> or <strong><u>internal</u></strong> motivation. Take some time after each one to think about your answer.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>	I play sports to relax me</li>
                <li>	I play music to be famous</li>
                <li>	I draw pictures so I can be an artist and make money </li>
                <li>	I study hard because my teacher wants me to do well</li>
                <li>	I help my mom at home because I care about her</li>
                <li>	I yell in class so that the other boys think I am cool</li>
                <li>	I am learning to read to get a job</li>
                <li>	I hug my baby because she is crying</li>
                <li>	I hug my baby because I love her </li>
                <li>	I take my medicine to get healthier </li>
            </ol>
            <p id="paraContent">
                Now Take some time and think about external and internal motivation <strong>in your life</strong>. <em>Which type of motivation do YOU prefer? You can write down your thoughts or share with a friend.</em><br><br>
                
                Now, let us look back to the proverb. How does it connect to <strong>external/internal motivation</strong>? <em>You can write down your thoughts or share with a friend.</em><br><br>
                
                The proverb means, <strong><em>If we first trust ourselves, believe in ourselves, motivate ourselves- we are stronger. Self-motivation or intrinsic motivation leads to success because it comes from within.</em></strong><br><br>
                
Take time to reflect on what you have learnt from todays lesson and the following questions; How does this motivation affect your day-to-day life? Are there other aspects of your life in which you need MORE motivation? What are they? Why is internal motivation important? How does it help you in your goals and future?  <br><br>
                
I hope today’s lesson helped you to discover yourself better and I hope you will reflect on the things you have learnt today.
