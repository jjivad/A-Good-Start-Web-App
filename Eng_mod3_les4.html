            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
In the last lesson, we explored our personal values and how they impact our wants and needs (choices). Today we are going to take that a step further by prioritizing what we spend our money on.<br><br>
                
                Let us start by reflecting on the meaning of the proverb, <strong><em>Roadside items are nice, but it takes money to buy</em></strong>. Think about it and we’ll come back at it at the end of the lesson. <br><br>
                <strong>What is prioritizing?</strong><br><br>
                
                <strong>Prioritizing</strong> means understanding that something is more important than something else. To prioritize something means <u>to put it first</u>. <br><br>
                
                <strong>For Example</strong>: Choosing to go to bed early instead of staying up late, so that you can be up for football practice in the morning, <em>I am prioritizing going to bed early over hanging out with my friends because soccer practice is important to me</em>.<br><br>
                
                <strong>How do we prioritize things to buy?</strong><br><br>
                
It’s as easy as 1-2-3. Let’s look at the 1-2-3 system to help us explore our priorities and what is important for our health and wellbeing. <br><br>
                
                1 are Items that are essential for healthy living - <strong><em><u>These are our NEEDS</u></em></strong> <br><br>
                
                2 are Items that are not essential but important to us - <strong><em><u>These could be NEEDS</u></em></strong> depending on our values.<br><br>
                
                3 are Items that are not essential and not important - <strong><em><u>These are our WANTS</u></em></strong> <br><br>
                
                Now that we know what is meant by prioritizing our needs, let’s look at our list of items from last session which include:<strong> Water, a car, food, clothing, a bike, football, shelter, a computer, a phone and health care</strong>. Find a partner, decide out of the needs, which are the most important and which are the least important. You will rank the needs in order of importance, using the 1-2-3 system and explain to each other why you have chosen the items in each. <br><br>
                
                Going back to the proverb we mentioned at the beginning of the lesson, <strong>Roadside items are nice, but it takes money to buy</strong>.<br>
                
                This proverb reminds us that <em>although things may be nice, they are not always a priority. We must first prioritize the things that will meet our survival needs, before buying our wants.</em>   <br><br>
                
                What a great class looking at priorities! I hope you have learnt a lot about <em><u>trying to figure out what is most important to you and how that will contribute to your health and wellbeing</u></em>.  Over the next few days, think more about the things that are important to you.
