            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script</strong> <br><br>
                In this lesson, we will go through what good health is, we shall also discuss what it means to be <strong>healthy</strong> or to have a <strong>healthy lifestyle</strong>. <br><br>
                
                But First, let us reflect on this African proverb, <strong><em>Before healing others, you must first heal yourself</em></strong>. Think about it and we’ll get back to it at the end of the lesson. <br><br>
                
                <em><u>What do you think health means</u></em>? Take some time and think about it. <br><br>
                
The current definition of health, formulated in 1948 by the WHO (World Health Organization) describes health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. In 1986, the WHO further clarified that health is, "A resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities." <br><br>
                
                <em><u>What are the types of health</u></em>? Think about it for a while. <br><br>
                
                The two main ways to define and classify good health is whether you have <strong>good mental health</strong>, or <strong>good physical health</strong>. These are the two most commonly discussed types of health. However, there are still discussions of spiritual health, emotional health and financial health. <br><br>
                
                <strong><em>Can you think of any other types of health not mentioned?</em></strong> <br><br>
                
                
                    <strong><em>What does each of these types of health mean?</em></strong><br><br>

Now, let us discuss more about physical and mental health<br><br>
                
                
                <strong><u>Physical health</u></strong><br><br>
                
When a person experiences physical health, it means that their bodily functions are working at peak performance, due not only to a lack of disease, but also to regular exercise, balanced nutrition and adequate rest. <br><br>
                
                Physical wellbeing involves pursuing a healthy lifestyle to decrease the risk of disease. For example, <em><u>maintaining physical fitness, can protect and develop the endurance of a person's breathing and heart function, muscular strength, flexibility, and body composition</u></em>. Physical health and well-being also help reduce the risk of an injury or health issues. <br><br>
                
                    <strong><u>Mental health</u></strong><br><br>
                
A person's mental health can be described as their emotional, social, and psychological wellbeing. Mental health is as important as physical health.<br><br>
                
                It is harder to define mental health than physical health, because, in many cases, <em><u>it depends on the individual's perception of their experience</u></em>. Mental health is not only the absence of stress, depression, anxiety, but it also depends on the ability to:
            </p>
            <ul><strong><em>
                <li>	enjoy life</li>
                <li>	bounce back after difficult experiences</li>
                <li>	adapt to changes easily</li>
                <li>	feel safe and secure</li>
                <li>	achieve your potential</li>
                </em></strong></ul>
            <p id="paraContent">
                <u>Physical and mental health are linked together</u>. If an illness affects a person's ability to complete their regular tasks, this may lead to depression and stress, for example, due to money problems because one is not able to provide for the family as expected.<br><br>
            
                It is important to approach <strong>"health"</strong> as a whole, meaning that a person must feel whole in all areas. <br><br>
            
                <strong><em>What Factors Contribute to Good Health?</em></strong><br><br>
            
Health depends on a wide range of factors. Environmental factors play a role in someone’s health. Sometimes the environment alone is enough to impact health. For example, people living in cold areas and people living in hot areas have different health concerns. <br><br>
            
                <strong>Can you think of any such example of certain concerns they may have?</strong><br> Share your thoughts with a friend.
Some of the other factors that affect a person’s health are:
            </p>
        <ul><strong><em>
            <li>	where a person lives</li>
            <li>	their income</li>
            <li>	their education level</li>
            <li>	relationships with friends and family</li>
            <li>	cultural issues</li>
            <li>	the gender of a person</li>
            </em></strong></ul>
        <p id="paraContent">
            Let’s revisit the proverb we discussed earlier in the class, <strong><em>Before healing others, you must first heal yourself.</em></strong> <br><br>
        
            The proverb means that <em><u>a person cannot claim to be whole if they have something in them that is failing</u></em>. The concept of understanding what good health is must begin with understanding if you as a person are whole and healthy. When one has determined that they are whole and healthy then can they be able to take care of their family’s health.
