                <em>Welcome all to your first session of A Good start! </em><br><br>
                This is a welcome session where we will outline how to work together through values and agreements. <br><br>
You will realize that each session will start with one or two African proverbs that will be important for the session. As we move through the sessions, we will discuss their relevance to our topic(s). Today, these are our proverbs:<br><br>
                <strong>1st proverb:</strong> <em>When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion</em> <br>
                <strong>2nd proverb:</strong> <em>No matter how big a farm is, it must have sections </em>
                <br>
                Think about the meaning of the proverb and we will get back to that at the end of the lesson. <br><br>
Now, let us look into working together in harmony, setting agreements and values.<br>
In making agreements, we try to keep the agreements positive. That is, we avoid using words like don’t, shouldn’t etc. we always check if everyone agrees with the statement.<br><br>
In a classroom set up, examples of agreements would be:<br>
                <em><strong>Listen when others speak</strong></em>, instead of, <em><strong>You shouldn’t talk when others are speaking</strong></em><br>
                <em><strong>Be kind to one another</strong></em>, instead of, <em><strong>Don’t be rude</strong></em><br><br>

                Other examples could be: <br>
                    <em><strong>Speak loud enough for everyone in the room to hear</strong></em> <br>
                    <em><strong>Listen and respect everyone’s ideas</strong></em> (even if you do not necessarily agree with them) <br>
                    <em><strong>Be yourself, and let others be themselves</strong></em> <br><br>
Now let’s revisit the two proverbs that we mentioned at the beginning of the session.<br><br>
                <strong>1st proverb:</strong> <em>When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion.</em> This proverb highlights the importance of working together to achieve goals, and that this is exactly what we hope to achieve in all of our sessions. <br><br>
                <strong>2nd proverb:</strong> <em>No matter how big a farm is, it must have sections.</em> This proverb states that even though we may need to work together, we all have unique skills.
