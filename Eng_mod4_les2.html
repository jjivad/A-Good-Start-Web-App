            <p id="paraContent">
            In this lesson we will learn how humans all came from the same place, and how they spread out across the world.<br><br>

To understand how different human cultures came to be I will read you a story. <br><br>

                <strong>This is the story told by science of what happened after humans were created. Some of you may know this story - it is the story of everyone in the whole world.</strong><br><br>
<em>
All humans were once one tribe, living in East Africa, from what is now southern Ethiopia to central Tanzania.<br>
We don't know much about their beliefs, stories and other cultural practices because it was so long ago.<br>
So much has been lost in the mists of time.<br>
But we can tell a lot from the tools and skeletons they left behind.<br><br>

We know they were nomadic hunters and they mostly ate meat, fish and birds.<br>
We know they also ate fruits, plants, wild grains, honey, and other similar food when they could find it.<br>
They did not eat any ugali, anjera, bread, rice or uji, because farming had not been invented yet.<br>
We know they had dark skin.<br>
We know they thought and imagined in the same way we did.<br><br>

They used a variety of tools and ornaments made from stone, obsidian, animal bone, ivory, plants and wood.<br>
(metal and plastic had not been invented yet)<br><br>
                </em>
But, like we saw in the last lesson, one tribe can split into different tribes – which can themselves split again and again.<br>
These new tribes move to new places, and their cultures and appearances change – just like in our game yesterday.<br><br>

Some went West, into what is now Western Africa.<br>
Some of their descendants became the Bantu, a group of people who spread out all across Sub-Saharan Africa.<br>
Today, Bantu peoples include: 
                </p>
            <ul>
                <li>	<strong>Congolese</strong></li>
                <li>	<strong>Baganda</strong> in Uganda</li>
                <li>	Both <strong>Tutsi</strong> and <strong>Hutu</strong> in Rwanda and Burundi</li>
                <li>	Many Kenyan tribes like the <strong>Kikuyu</strong>, the <strong>Kamba</strong>, the <strong>Kisii</strong>, the <strong>Luhya</strong> and many others</li>
                <li>	It also includes most peoples in all countries from <strong>Nigeria to Tanzania to South Africa</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p id="paraContent">
Some went North into the land surrounding the Nile Valley, in what is now South Sudan and Sudan.
Over the centuries, they spread back into East Africa
Today, many people in the Kakuma area are descendants of this group of humans. They include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>	The <strong>Nuer</strong>, <strong>Dinka</strong>, <strong>Mandari</strong> and <strong>Shilluk</strong> people from South Sudan – and others</li>
                <li>	The <strong>Turkana</strong> people</li>
                <li>	Various other Kenyan tribes, including the <strong>Maasai</strong>, the <strong>Luo</strong>, the <strong>Kalenjin tribes</strong>, the <strong>Samburu</strong></li>
                <li>	The <strong>Anuak</strong> in Ethiopia</li>
                <li>	The <strong>Acholi</strong> in Uganda</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="paraContent">
Other groups went to the North East, and their descendants became the various peoples from the Horn of Africa, including Somali people, and the peoples of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea.<br><br>

Other groups split from that first human tribe, and then left Africa entirely. 
Their descendants became all the peoples and cultures of the world.<br><br>
<em><u>
How do you feel knowing all humans were originally one tribe? <br>
How do you think the world would be if more people truly understood that?<br>
