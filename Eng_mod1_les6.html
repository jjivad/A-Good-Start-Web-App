            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
In the last session, we spent time imagining our future and visualizing our dreams. Now let’s use those visualization to move towards some concrete goals in our own lives. How do we use our dreams as motivation to move forward in our lives?<br><br>
                
                To begin with, what do you think this proverb means and what does it have to do with visualizing the future, <strong>If you wish to move mountains tomorrow, you must start by lifting stones today</strong>. <br><br>
                
When we wish to move towards our goals, there are important questions we need to ask ourselves. Take your time to reflect on them.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>	What are you most proud of in your life?</li>
                <li>	What is your favorite thing to do?</li>
                <li>	What would someone you love say is your biggest strength?</li>
                <li>	What would someone you love say is your biggest weakness?</li>
                <li>	If you could invent one new thing, what would it be? </li>
                <li>	What is an important lesson you have learned in your life? </li>
                <li>	If money was not an issue, what is the first thing you would do in the camp?</li>
                <li>	Who is closest to you? </li>
                <li>	What would you like to accomplish in your life?</li>
            </ol>   
           <p id="paraContent">     
               We will now focus on <strong>setting goals</strong> in different parts of our life. I want you to draw a circle in your notebook and then split their circle up into 6 parts: <em>Family, Career/Education, Religion, Self.</em> <br> <br> 
               
               For each of these sections in our lives, I want you to think about one positive change you will make. <strong>These will be your short-term goals</strong>, they do not have to be a big change, but just something that you will feel will improve your life. For Example, <strong>for the family, <em>I will spend more time helping my mother cook.</em></strong> <br> <br> 
               
               Now think back to the proverb that we looked at the beginning of the session. <strong>If you wish to move mountains tomorrow, you must start by lifting stones today.</strong>  How does this proverb relate to goal setting and what does it mean in regard to setting goals for you? <br> <br> 

Today’s session was very focused on concrete and practical ways we can make even small changes in our lives.  We look forward to seeing how you apply these changes to your day-to-day lives and congratulate you on completing the first module in A Good Start! You have already begun the journey to your ideal future!
