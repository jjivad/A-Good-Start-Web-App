                <em>Food is vital to life, and people get their food in different ways. In this lesson, we will explore how this affects our culture and way of life.</em><br><br>

                <strong>HUNTING</strong>, <strong>HERDING</strong>, <strong>FARMING</strong> and <strong>CITIES</strong> are the main <u><em>SOURCES</em></u> of food for people all around the world. CITIES includes shops, supermarkets, factories, charities, churches, and any other organisation in or from a city. Of course the original food itself comes from the ground or from animals, but it is usually very processed and is sold by companies.<br><br>

                These categories are also cultural categories - you can say a society is a <strong><em>HUNTER-GATHERER</em></strong> society, a <strong><em>PASTORALIST</em></strong> society, a <strong><em>FARMING</em></strong> society, or an <strong><em>URBAN</em></strong> society, depending on how the majority of their people sustain themselves.<br><br>

                <em>Urban is just a fancy way of saying a society has lots of cities!</em><br><br>

As we will see, all these categories of society are very related and interlinked.<br><br>

Letâ€™s get to answer the following questions about each category (Hunting, Herding, Farming, Cities): You can write down your thoughts or share with a friend
            </p>            
<ul><strong><em>
    <li>	What kinds of food can people get from each category? </li>
    <li>	Name some societies/cultures you know for each category </li>
    <li>	Where do people in each category make their homes? Do they move around or stay in one place?</li>
    <li>	 When do herders or farmers turn to hunting, or city people turn to small farming projects? <u>When the society does not get enough food from their normal sources</u>.</li>
    <li>	Are any of these categories reliant on the others? cities are reliant on herding and farming to get their raw food products. <u>In fact, cities cannot exist at all without farming</u>.</li>
    </em></strong> </ul>
            <p id="paraContent">
Let us discuss life in rural areas vs life in the city. <br><br>

                Societies using these food sources also live in different places. Those who depend on <strong>Hunting, herding and farming</strong> live in rural areas in small villages while urban societies live in cities.<br><br>

Think about the differences between:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>	Types of people you can meet</li>
                <li>	Community spirit</li>
                <li>	Traditions and beliefs</li>
                <li>	Access to services</li>
                <li>	Jobs available</li>
                <li>	The gap between rich and poor</li>
                <li>	How well they can deal with disasters and times of need</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="paraContent">
Lastly, let's talk about the West - countries like USA, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Sweden and the rest. <br>
                These are countries in which the majority of people live in cities. The traditional farming way of life is dying out in these countries. As the decades go by there are fewer and fewer small farming communities (most farming is run by businesses), with local cultures, traditions and even entire mother-tongue languages being lost. <br><br>

                <strong>How do you think it would feel to live in such a situation?</strong> <br>Perhaps you have friends who have been resettled who have first-hand stories about it. You can discuss with them.
