            <p id="paraContent">
                <strong>Script</strong> <br><br>
Today we will go through how eating well and having proper nutrition can lead to the entire well-being of the family.<br><br>
                
                As usual, let us reflect on the meaning of the following proverb and we’ll get back to it at the end of the lesson. <strong><em>When the heart is at ease, body is healthy</em></strong> <br><br>
                
For a family to be happy and healthy, nutrition is not the only requirement needed. It requires the efforts of every member to ensure the happiness of the other.<br><br>
                
                <em><u>What is your understanding of well-being</u></em>? Take some time and think about it.<br><br>
                
                Well-being of the family is defined as the individual well-being of each of the family members, <strong>the stability and quality relationships between them</strong>. The family serves as a strong hold during difficult times and its well-being serves as a motivation during such times. <br><br>
                
                Achieving family well-being is not instant or automatic but can be achieved through <strong>consistent communication among family members</strong>. <u>The relationship between parents and children significantly contribute to the well-being of the family</u>. Family connections can provide a greater sense of meaning and purpose. <em><u>The quality of family relationships</u></em> including <em><u>social support</u></em> can influence well-being of oneself; this is through psychosocial, behavioral and psychological support.  <br><br>
                
For example:<br><br>
                
                <strong><u>Parent or Guardian and Child relationship</u></strong><br>
Parents or Guardians are mentors for their children and their involvement in their children’s lives creates a vast impact in what they do. When parents have warm, trusting and reliable relationships with their peers, family and community members a positive relationship is also cultivated with their children.  <br><br>
                
Strong parent child relationships lead to better outcomes. Children in such kind of families can foster good relationships with people around them. In addition, the child’s mental, linguistic and emotional development take place helping the child to show optimistic and confident social behaviors. A secure attachment to the parents leads to a healthy social, emotional, cognitive and motivational development which is spread to the rest of the members.  <br><br>
                
                Now let us revisit the proverb from the beginning of the class. <strong>When the heart is at ease, body is healthy.</strong> <br><br>

                The proverb means, When the heart which in this case is the family unit is whole and happy, then the entire body or the person and their community can thrive. <strong><em>This is because when the family is well taken care of, and then their well-being can be seen to thrive throughout the community.</em></strong><br><br>

I hope you have all learnt what it means to thrive as a family unit and now you can make the necessary changes to ensure that the well-being of your family is maintained.
