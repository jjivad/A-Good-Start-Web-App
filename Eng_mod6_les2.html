                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
                Today we will go through what nutrition is, the foods we should take and the benefit that foods have in our bodies. This gives us a chance to <strong>identify the diseases that come with lack of proper nutrition</strong>.  We will also talk about the family well-being and how to ensure that apart from being healthy, we are able to relate with the members of the family in a productive way thus ensuring psychological wellbeing of everyone. <br><br>
                
We will begin by looking at a proverb and we’ll  get back to it at the end of the lesson.<br><br>
                
                <strong><em>'Your food is supposed to be your medicine and your medicine is supposed to be your food.'</em></strong><br><br>
                
                <u>What is Nutrition</u>? <br><br>
                
                <em>Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance of growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism.</em><br>
                Nutrition is also the <strong>intake of food</strong> considered in relation <strong>to the body’s dietary needs</strong>. Nutrients are therefore elements in food that are responsible for nourishing the body.<br><br>
                
Good nutrition promotes good health and prevents diseases such as diabetes, heart conditions, high blood pressure, cancer malnutrition diseases and obesity brought about by poor nutrition. <br><br>
                
                <strong>Why do you think nutrition is important?</strong>
                Share your thoughts with a friend<br><br>
                
 It is important that enough components of nutrients are present in your food. The following are functions of nutrition to our bodies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides the body with energy </li>
                <li>Provides protection against disease and regulates body processes</li>
                <li>Helps in body building</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="paraContent">
Our bodies require nutrients that is provided by the food we eat. They include; 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>	<h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
These are foods that provide our bodies with energy that support bodily functions and physical activity. In cases where protein is taken in less amounts, carbohydrates assume the body building function. <br><br> 
                    <strong>Sources of carbohydrates</strong> include: Cereals such as rice, maize, wheat; Roots and tubers such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, arrow roots and beetroot
                </li>
                <li>	<h3>Proteins </h3>
Proteins are important for body building. They ensure that there is growth, and they maintain and repair of our body tissues. Body tissues make up our organs. In cases when the body does not get enough carbohydrates to meet the energy needs, proteins are broken down to supply energy; however, this then makes it difficult for the proteins to perform their vital functions. <br><br>
                    <strong>Sources of proteins</strong>: Animal Protein- Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, curd, Plant protein- Soybeans, peas, cereals, nuts, oil seeds such as groundnuts 
                </li>
                <li>	<h3>Fats and Oils</h3>
                    Fats and oils are responsible of providing our bodies with energy. Fats are solid at room <strong>temperature</strong> while oils are <strong>liquid</strong> at room temperature. Fats and oils help in absorption of vitamins as well as maintain body temperature by laying fat under the skin this conserving heat. Fats and oils provide a cushion for the vital organs.<br><br>
                    <strong>Sources of fats and oil</strong>: Cooking oils, whole milk, eggs.
                </li>
                <li>	<h3>Vitamins </h3>

                <li>	<h3>Minerals</h3></li>
Minerals constitute a very small amount of the total body tissues. However, they are essential in ensuring vital processes of the body are done as well as maintenance of the body. The following are essential minerals for our bodies:
                <ul>
                    <li>	<strong><em>Iron</em></strong><br>
                        this is an important mineral in the body since it is present in haemoglobin which is part of red blood cells and is responsible for the red color of blood. Sources of iron include green vegetables, beans and green grams. Women and girls should particularly take in a lot of iron to avoid anemia due to loss of blood during the menstrual cycle. Iron is also required for pregnant women to ensure growth of the foetus.  </li>
                        <li>	<strong><em>Calcium</em></strong><br>
                        the major function of calcium is to ensure proper bone and teeth development. In addition, calcium helps in blood clotting and muscular contraction.  It is important that children, women and the elderly consume calcium providing foods to avoid poor bone development leading to frequent fractures. Sources of calcium include; green leafy vegetables and milk. </li>
                        <li>	<strong><em>Iodine</em></strong><br>
                        it is important to provide the body with iodine since it ensures brain development in children and prevent goiter in adults.  Sources of iodine include water, food and iodized salt. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>	<h3>Water </h3>
                    Water is the major component of our body. It helps in digestion, absorption and transportation of nutrients in the body. It helps excrete unwanted minerals and substances in our body through urine.  Water is responsible in ensuring our bodies maintain body temperature through perspiration.</li>
            </ol>
            <p id="paraContent">
Now let us revisit the proverb we mentioned at the beginning of the class. <br><br>

                The proverb states that, <strong><em>the food we eat has the potential to make us sick or to keep us healthy. Therefore, we should try as much as possible to eat well, try and eat a balanced diet so as to avoid getting sick.</em></strong><br><br>

Today’s session was to ensure that you understand nutrition, importance of good nutrition, and the nutrients we need to stay healthy. I hope this has created an opportunity for you to think of you and your family’s nutrition.
