                <strong>Script</strong><br><br>
                <em>Welcome back to our fifth lesson.</em> <br><br>
                In the previous lesson, we talked about turning challenges into possibilities. In this lesson, we will focus on <strong>personal motivations and goals</strong>. We will do this by <strong>imagining our future through visualizing our dreams</strong>. <br><br>
                
                To focus on our dreams, we will first need to <strong>ground ourselves</strong>- this means to <strong>calm ourselves down and bring our focus inside our bodies, minds and hearts</strong>. <br><br>
                
                To start with, what do you think is the meaning of the African Proverb, <strong><em>where there is no sleep, there is no dream.</em></strong> What does it have to do with visualizing dreams? Think about it and we will come back to it at the end of the lesson. <br><br>
                
                One of the great ways to focus on our dreams is to bring our attention <u>inward</u>. This is called <em><u>mindfulness</u></em>. It is used by many famous athletes, singers, and actors before sports or before they perform, to help them <strong>concentrate and relax</strong>, so they can visualize a win or a good performance. Let’s give it a try. <br><br>

                <strong>(Using a calm, slow voice read the following script to the students)</strong><br><br>

                <em>I will ask that you close your eyes. If closing your eyes feels uncomfortable, then please just look down at the floor. This is a time to focus on yourself- not those around you. Try to find a comfortable seated position with your feet touching the floor. <strong>(pause)</strong><br><br>
                
                    Begin to notice your breathing- just notice the inhale and exhale. <strong>(pause)</strong><br><br>
                
                    Notice the air enter and exit your lungs <strong>(pause for a few moments)</strong>. Try to deepen your breath, taking larger breaths IN and larger breaths OUT- trying to make the breath IN and then breath OUT the same length. <strong>(pause)</strong><br><br>
                
                    Then begin to notice your feet against the floor, maybe wiggle your toes around. Notice the solidity of the floor under your feet <strong>(pause for a few moments)</strong>. Feel your legs relax under you and your breathing continue to deepen <strong>(pause for a few moments)</strong><br><br>
                
                    Without opening your eyes, bring you focus back into the room – notice the sounds around you, notice the people around you <strong>(pause)</strong>. <br>
                </em>
                    And, whenever you feel ready, begin to open your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room.<br><br>
<em><strong>                
How did this exercise make you feel? <br><br>
                
Do you feel different than when you started?<br><br>
                
Did you enjoy it?<br><br>
    </strong>   </em>
                
Now let's begin to visualize our future. In this exercise we will travel in time into the future.<br><br> 
                Make yourself comfortable, try to keep your back straight but relaxed, with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting on your lap. Now close your eyes, or leave them resting on one spot on the floor and again begin to focus on your breath.  Breathing in and out. <strong>(pause)</strong><br><br>
                
Now begin to move through time- imagine that you are in the future- 10 years from now, in 2030. You are older than you are today and you have achieved what you want to achieve.<br><br>
                
                Where are you? <strong>(pause for 5-10 sec)</strong><br><br>
                What are you doing? <strong>(pause for 5-10 sec)</strong><br><br>
                Who are you with?  <strong>(pause for 5-10 sec)</strong><br><br>
                What is your living situation like? <strong>(pause for 5-10 sec)</strong> <br><br>
                Do you have a family? <strong>(pause for 5-10 sec)</strong><br><br>
                How are you feeling? Are you happy with you have become? <strong>(pause for 5-10 sec)</strong><br><br>
                
Begin to bring your focus back again to the present. Without opening your eyes, notice the sounds around you, notice your fee on the floor, your hands in your lap. Slow begin to open your eyes. <br><br>
                
Now take your notebook if you have one and begin to draw what you saw, thinking about how you felt. Think about what steps, even if they are very small, that could guide you to your future goals and dreams.<br><br>
                

                Now let us think back to the proverb we mentioned at the beginning of the lesson. <strong><em>Where there is no sleep, there is no dream.</em></strong> How is the proverb connected to what we did today? <br><br>
                
                The proverb means that,<em> without taking the time rest or to think, we cannot plan for the future. We need to take time to go inward, to focus and to rest to make the space and time to dream.</em><br><br>
                
                Today’s session really focused on hope and future thinking. I hope that you have had the opportunity to think about the elements in your future that are important to you and how you foresee the opportunity in your life to achieve your dreams and goals. <strong>As we end the lesson, think of one word to describe the session we have had.</strong>
